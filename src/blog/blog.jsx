                    <p className = "blogp">
                        The rejection from my dream programs were inevitable.  If I had no belief in myself then why would the universities.   But upon sculling and hitting an intense leg day, I realized something.  Its not over.  I still have a chance to get back on the right direction, an opportunity risky but my only chance left.: Transfer.   Although risky and often frowned upon by many, I honestly don't give a fuck.  If its a path to my dreams, a path to correct my mistakes in the past, then I will take it.     
                    </p>
                        <p className = "blogp">
                            Currently, its near the beginning of university, my ego already put myself in the 3 advanced courses: Math 145, 147, and CS 145, which honestly was not that bad- there is no stress greater than the minutes leading up to an important cross country race, learning the 4 entire courses in the span of two weeks,writing a 4000-word essay in four days, the unfairiness of IB English in which no matter how much effort I put in I see no reward.  But at last, although it hurts me, I may have to drop all these courses.  Although I came to university to learn, grow, to finally develop my problem-solving skills in a formal setting instead of just from textbooks— to finally learn from like-minded peers, and a funny, genuine, and inspiring professors, found in these advanced courses, I have a responsibility to my future-self to gain high-marks, not only to transfer and find co-op and internships, but not make the same mistake twice.

                    I found myself in a similar situation like this, and that was questioning if I should stay in IB, or not.  Ever since grade 6, I always wanted to go to IB, I wanted to challenge, I wanted to go to a famous program to be someone, and this childhood dream made me adamanant in staying in IB.  Although I made life-long friends and learned so much,

                             But another side of me, wants to take the challenge, its who I am.  Its only through challenges where I genuinely feel alive, to continiously improve is a philsophy.   So although theres hope to correct my wrongs- to fulfill my true potiental, I find myself in conflict.

                    <p className = "blogp">
                    I am almost finished highschool—I'm well into the second semester of grade 12 and as an IB student, all there is left are exams, which means, I have already started skipping to prepare for them.   And as I reflect over my high school years, I honestly feel disappointed.  I came into highschool aiming to be the best at everything I set myself in, dedicated to being productive with my life so that when I would look back at my high-school years, I would not feel as disappointed as I do now.   I’m not only not the best in my passions of running, coding, and math—which I hoped to be, but I have also not tried my very hardest in school.  I came into highschool aiming to have no regrets, and honestly today, that's all I have now. I achieved almost none of the goals I have set for myself which I whole-heartedly believe I could have achieved like qualifying for Math and Coding Olympiads
or getting into MIT...

           High School was supposed to be an opportunity for growth.  But all I developed were bad habits and a loss of confidence.  It is not the high school’s fault, I am to blame for all my failures.  Good things did happen.  But not to the degree I was expecting.   My two goals are now, unfortunately impossible.  I have failed.  I have let my past-self down and honestly I feel downgraded as a person.  I expected to feel more mature and A LOT smarter as I progressed through highschool, but I feel the same intelligence—maybe less, from when I first entered high-school.
	The situation I found myself in can only be attributed to me, and thus, I hope using this blog and journal, I can keep myself accountable as I move on past these regrets and show everyone what I can truly do.  
	So, what should be my focus now?  My dream, my end-all-be-all, my penultimate goal?  I was prepared to die for my dreams, but obviously if I truly was, the present would be a lot different.  I still have not lost hope for achieving success, being remembered, and having a minimum amount of regrets.  I still have not lost. I still have it in me to become better than all my competition.  In fact, I still truly believe I can be the best at anything I truly set my eyes to.  I know what I am capable of— how far I can push.  And this time? I will not settle for less until i’m fucking dead.  I will not let the pain of thousands of kilometers, hours, and hardwork in highschool go to waste.  I will not let failed-engineers, failed-doctors, stagnant, lazy, fat, weak, and complacent nobodies tell me what I can or can’t do.

On a similar note, to all the doubters out there:
Don’t compare me with you who long gave up being the best and achieving your dreams.  I’m willing to die for this, you sheltered plebs are not.  I would rather kill myself than live out a pitiful life like yours.

  	To end this, honestly, I hope the next time I enter this journal, I will be in a much better situation.  I will commit my remaining high school year to completing the IB Program, refining my three passions of running, math, and coding, and achieving something great.
