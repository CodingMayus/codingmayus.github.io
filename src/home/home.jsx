//  Hello! I am currently a high-school student from Canada interested in Mathematics, Competitive Programming, and other STEM subjects.

//Something about me is: I always had big dreams. In grade 7 it was to succeed in Math contests.  And now in High-school running and coding competitions are of interest as well. So when I am not busy with exams, running, lifting iron, or laughing at Instagram reels, you will find me working hard to improve my problem-solving skills.
